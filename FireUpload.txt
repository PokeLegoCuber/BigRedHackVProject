However much we do prepare, fires may still start due to natural phenomenon or an oversight. If a fire were to start, the most important thing is to prioritize your safety. If a fire starts, try to contain it. If the fire cannot be contained, escape the building and call 911. 

Here are some specific examples based on the obstacles in the game:

Toasters fires can start when toaster ovens malfunction. More commonly, they ignite bread/grain particles accumulated at the bottom of the tray. If a fire were to start, first unplug the toaster. Then try to smother the fire. If unable to contain the fire, escape the building and call 911.

While this may be a more cliché example, candles can still start fires if knocked over or overlooked. If a candle starts a fire, try to contain it with a blanket or water (Since it is not a grease or electric fire). If you cannot contain the fire, escape the building and call 911.
